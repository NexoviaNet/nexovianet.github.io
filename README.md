# Nexovia – A System of Care

**The system wasn’t built for us.**  
That’s the truth too many women already know — and the reason Nexovia exists.

Today’s health trackers, advice, and apps often fail women quietly.  
They’re built on male-centric data, push generic goals, and vanish when real life gets complex.  
Confusion, fatigue, and self-doubt aren’t weakness — they’re signals that the system was never designed to understand us.

## 🌱 What We’re Building

**Nexovia** isn’t just a product. It’s a **personalized, adaptive system of care** — designed to support women through every stage of life.

We’re starting with one critical phase (e.g., perimenopause) and expanding to build a full continuum:
- Puberty
- Hormonal cycles
- Fertility and postpartum
- Perimenopause
- Longevity

With Nexovia, you’ll be able to:

- Understand your body with clarity  
- Make decisions with confidence  
- Navigate transitions with meaningful support

## 🧠 How It Works

Our approach blends **precision and compassion**:

- 📊 Biosensor inputs (sleep, HRV, inflammation, mood)
- 🧬 Life-phase-specific insight models
- 🌙 Emotion-aware, adaptive tracking tools
- 🔐 A private, supportive space to reflect and connect

Because **data alone doesn’t create health**.  
Insight, timing, and connection do.

## 🧪 Current Prototype Focus

This early-stage prototype is being built and tested by a solo founder — using:
- Arduino-based ECG + temp sensors
- Python-based data pipelines
- Personalized experimentation to model use cases from the inside out

## ✍️ Built By

[@noturlluvia](https://github.com/noturlluvia)  
A systems thinker, data scientist, and product designer with lived experience of the problem.  
Nexovia is not a research paper — it’s a lived necessity.

---

## 📬 What's Next

We’re working toward:
- A validated MVP for a key life stage
- A private pilot with early users
- Data-backed insight loops that power the next version

Nexovia isn’t just a tracker.  
It’s the system too many women needed — and never had.  
Until now.
