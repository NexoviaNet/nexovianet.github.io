    <h1>Nexovia</h1>
    <p>The system wasn’t built for us.<br>
    Nexovia is a system of care designed to support women through every stage of life — with data, insight, and real compassion.</p>

      <h2>Why Nexovia</h2>
      <p>
        Most health systems were built on male data. They fail to capture the lived realities of women’s cycles, transitions, and hormonal shifts.
        Nexovia exists to fill that structural gap — not with another tracker, but with a system designed to understand and evolve with women’s bodies.

      <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>📊 Biosensor inputs (sleep, HRV, temperature, mood)</li>
        <li>🧬 Life-phase-specific insight models</li>
        <li>🌙 Emotion-aware, adaptive tracking tools</li>
        <li>🔐 A private, supportive space to reflect and connect</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’re starting with perimenopause — and building toward a continuum of care from puberty to longevity.</p>

      <h2>Current Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        We’re in early prototyping mode: logging biosignals, testing interpretation methods, and validating the experience with real-world data.
        Follow development in our <a href="https://github.com/NexoviaNet/nexovia-prototype" target="_blank">prototype repository</a>.
