    <h2>Why Nexovia</h2>
    <p>The system wasn’t built for us. That’s the truth too many women already know — and the reason Nexovia exists.</p>
    <p>Today’s health trackers, advice, and apps often fail women quietly. They’re built on male-centric data, push generic goals, and vanish when real life gets complex. Confusion, fatigue, and self-doubt aren’t weakness — they’re signals that the system was never designed to understand us.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
    <p><strong>Nexovia</strong> isn’t just a product. It’s a <strong>personalized, adaptive system of care</strong> — designed to support women through every stage of life.</p>
    <p>We’re starting with one critical phase (e.g., perimenopause) and expanding to build a full continuum:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Puberty</li>
      <li>Hormonal cycles</li>
      <li>Fertility and postpartum</li>
      <li>Perimenopause</li>
      <li>Longevity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With Nexovia, you’ll be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand your body with clarity</li>
      <li>Make decisions with confidence</li>
      <li>Navigate transitions with meaningful support</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Our approach blends <strong>precision and compassion</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📊 Biosensor inputs (sleep, HRV, inflammation, mood)</li>
      <li>🧬 Life-phase-specific insight models</li>
      <li>🌙 Emotion-aware, adaptive tracking tools</li>
      <li>🔐 A private, supportive space to reflect and connect</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because <strong>data alone doesn’t create health</strong>. Insight, timing, and connection do.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Prototype</h2>
    <p>This early-stage prototype is being built and tested by a solo founder — using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arduino-based ECG + temperature sensors</li>
      <li>Python-based data pipelines</li>
      <li>Personalized experimentation to model use cases from the inside out</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Founder</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/noturlluvia">@noturlluvia</a> is a systems thinker, data scientist, and product designer with lived experience of the problem. Nexovia is not a research paper — it’s a lived necessity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A validated MVP for a key life stage</li>
      <li>A private pilot with early users</li>
      <li>Data-backed insight loops that power the next version</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nexovia isn’t just a tracker. It’s the system too many women needed — and never had. Until now.</p>
